/**
 * Single source of truth for the four pieces of exams-tab data that feed
 * the shared fast-tab cache (terms, classes, exam types, subjects).
 *
 * Previously each of useExamsTabState / useExamTypeActions / useSubjectActions
 * owned its own slice via useState, and cache writes needed a `getSnapshot`
 * callback threaded between the three hooks so a write from one hook could
 * see the others' latest values. That's the closure-coupling smell: state
 * that's really one page's worth of data, sliced across sibling hooks and
 * stitched back together through a ref-like indirection.
 *
 * This reducer holds all four fields together so every update goes through
 * one explicit channel (`dispatch`) and the fast-tab cache can be kept in
 * sync from a single place (see useExamsTabState's cache-sync effect)
 * instead of scattering `writeExamsCache(getSnapshot(), ...)` calls across
 * every mutator in the sibling hooks.
