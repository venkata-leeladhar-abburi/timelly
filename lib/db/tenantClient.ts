/**
 * A second, opt-in Prisma connection using the restricted `app_tenant`
 * Postgres role (see prisma/migrations/20260923104016_create_app_tenant_role
 * and docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md). Unlike the app's normal `lib/db.ts` client -
 * which connects as the table-owning role and always bypasses RLS - queries
 * run through this client are genuinely restricted by the RLS policies added
 * in the two `..._rls_policies_..._schoolid_tables` migrations, PROVIDED the
 * caller sets `app.current_school_id` first (see `withTenantScopedClient`
 * below). Proven correct against real production data in this session: a
 * connection with no context set sees zero rows, and a connection scoped to
 * school A cannot read school B's data even when explicitly asked to.
 *
 * NOT wired into any route yet. Existing routes continue to rely entirely on
 * `requireSchoolId()` (lib/auth/tenant.ts) for tenant scoping - switching a
 * route to use this client is a deliberate, one-route-at-a-time decision
 * (query shape has to move from `where: { schoolId }` to relying on RLS,
 * every affected Prisma call in that route has to move inside the same
 * transaction, and the route needs its own before/after isolation test run
 * against the real DB, not just mocks). See docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md for the
 * full rollout plan.
 *
 * Requires DATABASE_URL_TENANT to be set (same connection details as
 * DATABASE_URL/DIRECT_URL, but with the app_tenant role's own username and
 * password - Supabase's pooler expects "app_tenant.<project-ref>" as the
 * username). Throws at first use if that env var is missing, rather than
 * silently falling back to an unscoped connection.
