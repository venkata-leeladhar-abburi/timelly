`# Security Review — Phase 6 (2026-09-23)
`
`Scope: (1) the "fail open to stale JWT on DB error" tradeoff in auth, and
`(2) an audit of the RLS/tenant-isolation model against real cross-tenant
`attack scenarios. This follows Phase 4 (architecture normalization),
`which is complete.
`
`## 1. Fail-open JWT sync — is it still the right call?
`
`**Location**: `lib/auth/authOptions.ts`, `jwt` callback.
`
````js
`const shouldSyncFromDb = (() => {
`  if (!token.id) return false;
`  const stale = Date.now() - (token._dbSyncAt ?? 0) > 5 * 60 * 1000;
`  const missingCritical = token.schoolId == null || token.allowedFeatures == null;
`  return stale || missingCritical;
`})();
`
`if (shouldSyncFromDb && token.id) {
`  try {
`    const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: token.id }, select: {...} });
`    if (dbUser) { /* refresh token.schoolId, allowedFeatures, image, schoolIsActive; token._dbSyncAt = Date.now() */ }
`  } catch (error) {
`    console.error("jwt_db_sync_failed", ...);
`    // returns the OLD token unchanged — no rethrow
`  }
`}
````
`
`**What's stale, and for how long**:
`- `schoolId`, `allowedFeatures`, `photoUrl` can lag the DB by up to 5
`  minutes under normal conditions, and by the full duration of a DB
`  outage if the sync keeps failing (`_dbSyncAt` isn't advanced on
`  failure, so it keeps retrying every request but never succeeds until
`  the DB recovers).
`- `role` is **never** re-synced after login at all — a role change or
`  downgrade only takes effect on the user's next login or JWT expiry.
`- Account deactivation (`password: null`) is checked only in `authorize()`
`  at login — an existing session for a deactivated user keeps working
`  until the JWT expires, DB outage or not.
`
`**Verdict: still the right call, with two gaps worth closing.**
`
`The core tradeoff is sound: an auth-layer exception should not turn a
`transient DB blip into a full outage for every logged-in user across
`every tenant. Swallowing the sync failure and continuing with the
`existing token is the standard "availability over freshness" choice for
`this kind of best-effort cache refresh, and 5 minutes of staleness on
``schoolId`/`allowedFeatures` is a reasonable bound in the common case.
`
`Two things are worth fixing, independent of RLS:
`
`1. **No staleness ceiling during an outage.** If the DB stays down for an
`   hour, a user whose `schoolId` or `allowedFeatures` changed at the
`   start of that hour keeps their old permissions for the full hour, not
`   just 5 minutes. Consider tracking the number of consecutive sync
`   failures (or the age since the *last successful* sync) and forcing
`   re-authentication past some hard ceiling (e.g. 30–60 min), rather than
`   trusting a token indefinitely just because the DB is unavailable.
`2. **Deactivation and role are never re-checked outside login.** A
`   SUPERADMIN or SCHOOLADMIN demoted mid-session, or a user deactivated
`   mid-session, keeps full access until their token naturally expires.
`   If session lifetime is long (check `session.maxAge` in
`   `authOptions.ts`), this is a meaningful window. Recommend adding
`   `isActive`/`role` to the periodic sync payload (already fetching the
`   user row; cheap to include) — that closes both gaps with the existing
`   fail-open shape intact, since the sync already has its own error
`   handling.
`
`Neither gap changes the fail-open decision itself — they tighten what
`gets trusted while the sync is working, and how long the app trusts a
`sync that stopped working.
`
`## 2. RLS / tenant-isolation audit — critical finding
`
`**RLS as currently configured provides no tenant isolation.**
`
`Migrations `20260923042848_enable_rls_public_tables` and
``20260923043530_enable_rls_prisma_migrations` run
``ALTER TABLE "X" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` on ~50 tables, but attach
`**zero policies**. The migration's own comment is explicit about scope:
`this was done purely to silence Supabase's security advisor for its
`auto-generated PostgREST/GraphQL API, which this app never uses — all
`reads/writes go through Prisma using the table-owning role. In Postgres,
`the owning role bypasses RLS by default regardless of whether RLS is
`enabled or how many policies exist. There is no `SET app.current_school_id`,
`no `current_setting()` call, and no per-connection tenant context
`anywhere in the codebase (confirmed by grep across `.ts`/`.sql`).
`
`**Real isolation is 100% application-level**: every route handler must
`call `requireSchoolId(session)` (`lib/auth/tenant.ts`) and thread that
`value into every Prisma `where` clause. This includes ~12 route files
`that use `$queryRaw`/`$executeRaw`/`$executeRawUnsafe` (e.g.
``app/api/chairman/dashboard/route.ts`, `app/api/exam-subjects/route.ts`,
``app/api/fees/discount-approvals/route.ts`) — spot-checked, and these do
`correctly parameterize `schoolId` into the raw SQL, but there is **no
`database-level backstop** if a future raw query, or a future Prisma call,
`omits it.
`
`### Attack scenarios
`
`| Scenario | Currently blocked by | Residual risk |
`|---|---|---|
`| Authenticated SCHOOLADMIN of School A requests `/api/student/list?schoolId=B` (tampered param) | Only if the route ignores the client-supplied `schoolId` and uses `requireSchoolId(session)` instead | **Route-by-route**: any handler that trusts a body/query `schoolId` over the session-derived one is exploitable. Not systematically enforced — needs an audit pass (see recommendation below) or a lint rule. |
`| A new route/query added later forgets the `schoolId` filter entirely | Nothing — no DB-level check exists | High: this is a straightforward regression risk with zero automated detection today. |
`| A raw SQL query (`$queryRaw`) is added without the `schoolId` predicate | Nothing | Same as above, plus raw SQL is easier to get subtly wrong (e.g. a `JOIN` that reintroduces unscoped rows). |
`| Compromised app server / stolen DB credentials used directly (bypassing the Next.js app) | Nothing — Prisma's role has full cross-tenant read/write by design | This is normal for a single-tenant-DB SaaS without DB-enforced RLS; only relevant if the threat model includes "attacker with DB credentials but not app code," which is a different tier of compromise. |
`
`### Recommendation
`
`This is a materially weaker isolation model than "DB-enforced RLS," and
`the plan phrasing ("audit the new RLS policies") assumed policies exist
`that don't. Two paths forward, not mutually exclusive:
`
`1. **Cheap, do first**: add a test/lint safety net for the isolation the
`   app already relies on — e.g. a script that greps every
`   `app/api/**/route.ts` touching a tenant-scoped model and asserts it
`   calls `requireSchoolId`/uses `schoolId` in its Prisma calls, or
`   integration tests per tenant-scoped route that assert a School-A
`   session cannot read School-B rows (create two seeded tenants in test
`   setup, assert 403/404/empty result). This directly tests the actual
`   enforcement mechanism instead of a DB feature that isn't wired up.
`2. **Bigger lift, optional**: implement genuine DB-level RLS — have
`   Prisma connect as a non-owning role for request-scoped queries, add
`   `SET LOCAL app.current_school_id = ...` per request/transaction, and
`   write a real policy per tenant-scoped table
`   (`USING ("schoolId" = current_setting('app.current_school_id')::int)`).
`   This is a real architectural change (connection/role management,
`   transaction wrapping every request), not a follow-up migration — size
`   it separately if the team decides the defense-in-depth is worth it.
`
`Until one of these lands, tenant isolation depends entirely on every
`current and future route handler remembering to filter by `schoolId`.
`That's the single most important fact to carry into future work on this
`codebase — recorded here and in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
`
`## 3. Real DB-level tenant isolation — rollout status and decisions
`
`**Mechanism.** Routes run their queries on a second Prisma connection that uses the
`restricted `app_tenant` Postgres role (`DATABASE_URL_TENANT`), inside one transaction
`with `app.current_school_id` set (`lib/db/tenantClient.ts`). RLS policies (migrations
``20260923104652_*`, `20260923105153_*`) then restrict every read and write to that school,
`independent of the `schoolId` in application `where` clauses. Verified live: a connection
`with no context sees 0 rows; a school-A-scoped connection asking for school B sees 0 rows.
`
`Two entry points:
`
`- `withTenantScopedClient(schoolId, tx => ...)` — explicit `tx`, used by the simple routes.
`- `runInTenantScope(schoolId, fn)` + `tenantDb` (`lib/db/tenantContext.ts`) — request-scoped
`  (AsyncLocalStorage) so shared helpers in `lib/*` need no `tx` plumbing. Outside a scope
`  `tenantDb` falls back to the owner client (scripts, cron, unmigrated callers).
`  `tenantDb.$transaction` joins the scope's transaction.
`
`**Status.** 106 of 178 route files use a tenant scope (reads and, where safe, writes);
`11 are `superadmin/*`.
`
`**Decision — superadmin cross-tenant carve-out.** SUPERADMIN endpoints stay on the
`owner-role connection. They are cross-tenant by definition, the owner role already bypasses
`RLS, and adding a BYPASSRLS role or an `app.is_superadmin` policy branch would create a
`second, broader credential and a policy path every tenant table would have to honour.
`The carve-out is instead made explicit and auditable: `superadmin/*` routes, plus a small
`set of routes with a genuine unscoped path, use the owner client directly or
``runInOptionalTenantScope(null, ...)`. `lib/db/ownerConnectionRoutes.test.ts` keeps a
`baseline of routes importing the owner `prisma` and fails when a new one appears.
`Consequence: a compromised SUPERADMIN session, or the owner DB credential, is still
`cross-tenant — RLS protects tenant users from each other, not from the platform operator.
`
`**Known limits.**
`
`- One scope = one transaction: queries run serially, the shared prisma extension's read
`  collapsing does not apply, and the transaction is capped at `TENANT_SCOPE_TIMEOUT_MS`
`  (default 30s; bulk routes use 120s). Time heavy fee/analysis routes on production-sized data.
`- A failed statement aborts the whole Postgres transaction, so write handlers that catch
`  DB errors (`P2002`/`P2025`) and carry on were NOT wrapped. They stay on the owner connection.
`- Tables with RLS enabled but no policy return 0 rows to `app_tenant`: `PaymentWebhookEvent`,
`  `SystemSubscription`, `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken`. Never touch them from a scope.
`- Not migrated: payment create/verify/webhook, auth, uploads, user/school create and
`  update, admissions bulk upload, and other handlers listed in
`  `lib/db/ownerConnectionRoutes.json`.
`
`**Deployment checklist.** (1) Set `DATABASE_URL_TENANT` (`app_tenant.<project-ref>` user on the
`pooler); `instrumentation.ts` logs an error at boot if it is missing. (2) Apply the RLS and
``app_tenant` migrations to the target database. (3) Re-run the cross-tenant check against that
`database. (4) Watch latency and P2028 (transaction timeout) errors on fee/analysis routes.
`
`**Benchmark results (2026-09-24, from a high-latency dev machine, largest school, 821 students).**
``scripts/benchmark-tenant-scope.ts` compares owner vs scoped on the heavy helpers. Scoped time was
`0.84-0.91x of owner (the scope adds only BEGIN/set_config/COMMIT; round trips dominate), so the scope
`is not slower per se. Absolute times here (12-47s) are dominated by ~1-3s per round trip on that link
`and say nothing about the deployment region: rerun the script there before relying on the 30s cap.
`Content was identical to the owner connection for every case checked. Row order among ties (queries
`without a total ORDER BY, e.g. top teachers, fee allocation lines) can differ because RLS changes the
`plan. Scopes slower than half the timeout log \`tenant_scope_slow\`; a timeout logs
`\`tenant_scope_timeout (P2028)\` with the school and duration.

### 3.1 Write handlers and the owner connection (final state)

Wrapping a whole write handler in one scope makes it a single transaction. That is wrong when
the handler (a) recovers from a DB error and carries on (a failed statement aborts the whole
Postgres transaction, so the final COMMIT would fail and everything be lost), (b) runs before a
tenant exists, (c) must commit independently of a gateway or caller, or (d) starts work that
outlives the request. Techniques used instead of leaving a handler unscoped:

- **Per-call scopes** where recovery is per statement: each `runInTenantScope(...)` is its own
  transaction, so a failed attempt rolls back and the fallback starts fresh (`newsfeed/create`,
  `newsfeed/[id]` PUT/DELETE Prisma-then-raw-SQL fallbacks, `fees/structure/bulk` per-class saves,
  `teacher/attendance` POST after its DDL self-heal check, per-row saves in the three bulk imports).
- **Owner-client helpers for fire-and-forget work**: `lib/notificationService.ts` and
  `lib/newsfeedRetention.ts` use the owner client, so a `createNotification(...).catch(() => {})`
  started inside a scope cannot run on an already-closed transaction and silently vanish.
- **Optional scope** (`runInOptionalTenantScope(session.user.schoolId, ...)`) for self/participant-
  scoped writes (notifications, leaves, marks, appointments, messages, homework submit, profile,
  password change): scoped when the session has a school, otherwise unchanged.
- **Deliberate cross-tenant reads stay on the owner client**: the "Aadhaar must be unique across
  ALL schools" check in `student/bulk-upload` (RLS would hide other schools' students and silently
  disable it), and the initial student lookup in `fees/student/[id]` PATCH (it discovers the
  student's school before scoping to it).

**Still on the owner connection, and why**

| Group | Handlers | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| No tenant context yet | `auth/[...nextauth]`, `school/create` | Login and school creation happen before a school exists |
| Payments / gateway | `payment/create-order`, `verify`, `refund`, `webhook`; `parent/subscription/create-order`, `verify`; `fees/offline-payment`; `student/offline-payment` | Webhooks have no session or tenant; multi-step external gateway calls with `$transaction`; SUPERADMIN paths; they must commit independently of the HTTP response. Money paths are the last place to change transaction semantics without a dedicated test plan |
| Mixed SUPERADMIN / tenant | `fees/discount-approvals/[id]` (POST/PATCH, delegating handler) | Superadmin acts across tenants; needs a per-caller split |
| Background work | `student/[id]` PUT | Starts `void` background tasks that outlive the request, and a reactivation `catch` that returns after a partial commit on purpose |
| Not tenant data | `upload` | Object storage only |
| Cross-tenant by design | `superadmin/*` | See the superadmin decision above |

Everything else that writes is inside a tenant scope. `lib/db/ownerConnectionRoutes.json` is the
baseline of route files that still import the owner client (reads and writes); the test in
`lib/db/ownerConnectionRoutes.test.ts` keeps it honest.

**Order-tie fix (verified live).** The order differences above are removed: tiebreakers were added to
top teachers / subject performance (`buildSchoolAnalysis.ts`), fee-head lines (`paymentFeeHeadLines.ts`),
and total `ORDER BY`s on the payment, allocation and admission-payment queries
(`loadDayFeeCollectionTransactions.ts`, `loadAdmissionFeeDayReportTx.ts`, `fees/transactions`). On the
largest school, `school/analysis` and the 1298-row fee report are now byte-identical between the owner
connection and a tenant scope, order included.
