/**
 * Tenant-isolation safety net (docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md, finding #2, recommendation #1).
 *
 * There is no database-level tenant isolation in this app (RLS is enabled but has
 * zero policies — see docs/SECURITY_REVIEW.md). Every route touching a tenant-scoped
 * table must derive `schoolId` from the session and thread it into its Prisma/raw-SQL
 * calls. This script runs two independent heuristic checks, neither a proof of
 * correctness:
 *
 * 1. Total-miss check: finds every Prisma model that has a `schoolId` field (from
 *    prisma/schema.prisma), scans every app/api/**\/route.ts for calls against those
 *    models (`prisma.<model>.<action>(` or `tx.<model>.<action>(`), and flags a route
 *    that calls a tenant-scoped model but never mentions `schoolId` anywhere in the
 *    file — the "forgot to scope the query" regression.
 *
 * 2. Client-controlled-fallback check (added after PRODUCTION_READINESS.md found this
 *    exact bug in app/api/fees/discount-approvals/route.ts: it mentioned `schoolId`,
 *    so check #1 would NOT have caught it, but the schoolId it used could come from
 *    `?schoolId=` on the request instead of the session): flags any route that reads
 *    `searchParams.get(...schoolId...)` or `body.schoolId` / `body["schoolId"]` — a
 *    request-supplied schoolId used to scope a tenant query is exactly as dangerous
 *    as no scoping at all, since an attacker chooses the value.
 *
 * Neither check tries to verify that `schoolId` is threaded correctly into every
 * individual query (that would need real static analysis of Prisma `where` clauses).
 * Routes that legitimately query across tenants, or that intentionally accept a
 * schoolId from the request (superadmin dashboards, the NextAuth handler, etc.), are
 * allowlisted below — one allowlist per check, since a route can be fine for one and
 * not the other.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/checkTenantIsolation.ts
 * Exits non-zero (and prints the offending files) if either check finds a hit outside
 * its allowlist.
